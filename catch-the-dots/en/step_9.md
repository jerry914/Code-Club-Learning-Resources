## What next?

Try the [Clone wars](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/clone-wars?utm_source=pathway&utm_medium=whatnext&utm_campaign=projects) project to make a game in which you have to save the Earth from space monsters. In that project, you will be able to use what you have learned about cloning sprites and adding a score!

Score as many points as you can by shooting flying space-hippos. If you get hit by a hippo or by an orange dropped by the bats, you lose a life.
