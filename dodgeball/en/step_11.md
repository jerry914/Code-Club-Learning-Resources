## Challenge: more lives

Right now, your character goes back to its starting position when it gets hit. Can you also give the character sprite three `lives`{:class="block3variables"}, and make it lose one life when it gets hit? Here's how your game could work:

+ The game starts with three lives for the character
+ Whenever the character gets hit, it loses one life **and** moves back to the start
+ If there are no lives left, the game ends
