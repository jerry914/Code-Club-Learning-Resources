## Challenge: better jumping

Even if the character is already in mid-air, it jumps whenever the player presses the <kbd>space</kbd> bar. You can see this behaviour if you hold down the <kbd>space</kbd> bar.

Can you change the character sprite's code for jumping so that your character can only jump `if`{:class="block3control"} it touches a blue platform?
