## Challenge: random balls

The balls that your character has to dodge all look the same, and they appear at regular three-second intervals. Can you add code to your game so that the balls:

+ Don't all look the same?
+ Appear after a `random`{:class="block3operators"} amount of time?
+ Are a random size?
