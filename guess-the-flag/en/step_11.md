## Challenge: improve the game

+ Add a fixed number of rounds and then tell the player the percentage of rounds in which they gave the correct answer.

+ Store the high score.

[[[generic-scratch3-high-score]]]

+ Add a timer for each round to force the player to give their answer quickly.

+ Add more flags to make the game more challenging.

+ If the player clicks on an incorrect flag, have the game remove that flag and give the player another chance to answer correctly before the next round begins.

+ Make the game into a two-player quiz where players take turns to guess, and their scores are recorded separately.
