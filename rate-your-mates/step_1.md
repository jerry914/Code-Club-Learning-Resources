## Introduction

You are going to code your micro:bit to tell you how compatible you are with your friends.

__Instructions__: If you're reading this online, press __A+B__ on the micro:bit below with a friend to find out your friendship rating.

## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to make use of variables and random numbers by making a compatibility program. Two users will each press a button on the micro:bit, which will then tell them their compatibility percentage.

## Resources
For this project, the [MakeCode (PXT)](http://jumpto.cc/mb-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:57756-45098-79806-84952](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:57756-45098-79806-84952), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ microbit-Rate-Your-Mates.hex

## Learning Objectives
+ `>` and `<` relational operators;
+ Repetition (`for` loop).

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

## Challenges
+ "Low rating" - Use of `if` statement and `<` relational operator to show a cross or a sad face if the rating is under 25.
+ "More animations" - Use of a `for` loop to create more animations.
