Open the Scratch starter project.

**Online**: open the starter project at [rpf.io/skiingon](http://rpf.io/skiingon){:target="_blank"}.

If you have a Scratch account you can make a copy by clicking **Remix**.

**Offline**: open the [starter project](http://rpf.io/p/en/scratch-cat-goes-skiing-go){:target="_blank"} in the offline editor.

If you need to download and install the Scratch offline editor, you can find it at [rpf.io/scratchoff](http://rpf.io/scratchoff){:target="_blank"}.

In the starter project, you should see a blank backdrop and a skier sprite.
