## Challenge: improve your game!
Now that you've made the basic game, see what you can do to improve it. Here are some ideas, but feel free to use your own ideas too.

+ Add a winter backdrop to your project.
+ Change the numbers in your code, to make the snowball move faster, higher or further
+ Change the graphics
+ Add music and sound effects
+ Change sprite costumes when the target is hit
+ Add a score and a high score
+ The reindeer could move around so that it's harder to hit
+ You could add snowflakes or birds that stop the snowball
+ You could add a second player, so that you could both throw snowballs at the reindeer...or each other!
